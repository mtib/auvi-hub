# AuVi - Hub
This is the EAA (Extra Academic Activity) by
- Markus Becker
- Swenja Wagner

Our Project Manager is Dr. Ronald Eixmann

## File Structure
This Project is structured in Code (mostly python2.7) and LaTeX.

We need to write a pretty complex documentation.

The newest version of our latex document is found as [auvi_bl2.tex](/Latex/Lernleistung/auvi_bl2.tex) with [auvi_bl2.pdf](/Latex/Lernleistung/auvi_bl2.pdf) being it's generated Pdf.

## Running our Program
If you want to truly understand what is happening and you speak german, you should be able to read our documentation, otherwise, as long as we haven't written a english version of that, you probably have to reverse engineer our code.

The start point for our program is [auvi.py](/Code/PyVi/auvi.py).

You can start the standard routine with:

```python
python auvi.py
```
