AuVi - Hub
==========
This is the EAA (Extra Academic Activity) by
- Markus Becker
- Swenja Wagner

Our Project Manager is Dr. Ronald Eixmann

File Structure
--------------
This Project is structured in Code (mostly python2.7) and LaTeX.

We need to write a pretty complex documentation.

The newest version of our latex document is found as [auvi_bl2.tex](/Latex/Lernleistung/auvi_bl2.tex) with [auvi_bl2.pdf](/Latex/Lernleistung/auvi_bl2.pdf) being it's generated Pdf.  

Running our Program
--------------------
If you want to truly understand what is happening and you speak german, you should be able to read our documentation, otherwise, as long as we haven't written a english version of that, you probably have to reverse engineer our code.

The start point for our program is [auvi.py](/Code/PyVi/auvi.py).

You can start the standard routine with:

```python
python auvi.py
```
