{"name":"Auvi-hub","tagline":"Jugend Forscht - Complete Work","body":"# AuVi - Hub\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tibyte/auvi-hub.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tibyte/auvi-hub)\r\n\r\nThis is the EAA (Extra Academic Activity) by Markus Becker\r\n\r\nYou can have a look at the built documentation [here](http://viwetter.de/ci/Latex/Lernleistung/bll.pdf).\r\n\r\nMy Project Manager is Dr. Ronald Eixmann\r\nI need to mention my ex-co-worker Swenja Wagner as a big influence on this project.\r\n\r\n## File Structure\r\nThis Project is structured in Code (mostly python2.7) and LaTeX.\r\n\r\n## Running our Program\r\nIf you want to truly understand what is happening and you speak german, you should be able to read our documentation, otherwise, as long as we haven't written a english version of that, you probably have to reverse engineer our code.\r\n\r\nThe start point for our program is [auvi.py](/Code/PyVi/auvi.py).\r\n\r\n## Compiling documentation\r\n```bash\r\ncd Latex/Lernleistung\r\nxelatex bll.tex\r\nbibtex bll\r\nxelatex bll.tex\r\n```\r\nThis needs texlive or mktex to be installed as well as xetex or xelatex and bib(la)tex. You might be able to run another version of Latex, but I am only testing it to be compatible with xelatex.\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\nIf you want to contact me directly about this project, do so via GitHub. Otherwise please email me: [Markus Becker](mailto:markus@tibyte.net?subject=AuVi)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
